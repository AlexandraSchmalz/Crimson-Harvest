### requirements

- In order to see and mark a timespan, I want a monthly calendar view.
- In order to view and add details to a day, I want a detail calendar view.
- In order to analyze the tracked events, I want a diagram view.
- In order to mark a timespan, I want to mark a day as start/ end.
- In order to avoid confusion, the app allows only start or end.
- Because it is convenient, the app will continue marking days from the start mark till present day if no end mark is set.
- Because overlapping Entities are **EEEEVIIIIL**, a started entity automatically stops before the start of another similar entity.  
- In order to track different events, I can create different tracking entities.
- Because I REALLY like resets, I want a reset button (soft, hard).
- In order to reach a broader market, I need a cross platform app.
- In order to keep additional information, I want to add notes to a specific day.
- Because it is convenient, I can create custom attributes for each entity.
- In order to use on multiple devices, I can sync it with the *cloooooooud*
- In order to appease the very picky customer, the app is highly customizable (to be defined).
