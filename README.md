# Crimson Harvest
Crimson Harvest is a lightweight calendar for tracking timespans and adding notes.

It is written with Dart and Flutter and can be therefore used for Android and IOS.

The app displays a scrollable calendar where notes can be added to a day and the start and end of a timespan can be marked. If no end is marked, the timespan will automatically include everything up to the current day.

The app is only intended to work as a notebook and makes no predictions for further events.

The original purpose of the app is to work as a menstruation tracker, but it is designed non-specific enough in order to be used for tracking different things too.

## Future
The app is still a work in progress and features will be added, including: 
- using widgets for custom notes (e.g. scales from 1 to 5)
- use of themes and a high level of customization
- marking days with saved notes
